## Architecture

![](/images/architecture.png)

By default, we use AWS App Runner, which is commonly used to host Python FastAPI servers, offering high performance,
scalability and low latency.

Alternatively, we provide the option to replace App Runner with AWS Lambda using Function URLs for a more cost-effective
solution, as shown in
this [example](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter/tree/main/examples/fastapi-response-streaming).

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up your API Key

1. Click <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/parameters/" target="_blank">Parameter Store</a> to open your AWS Console.
2. Check whether you are in the [supported region](#supported-region), then click on the "Create parameter" button.
3. Name: Enter a descriptive name for your parameter (e.g., "SwiftChatAPIKey").
4. Tier: Select **Standard**.
5. Type: Select **SecureString**.
6. Value: Any string without spaces (This value is your API Key which should fill in your App's Settings page).
7. Click "Create parameter".
8. Make a note of the parameter name you used (e.g., "SwiftChatAPIKey"). You'll need this in the next step.

### Step 2: Deploy stack and get your API URL

1. Click the following button to launch the CloudFormation Stack in the same region with your API Key just created.
    - App Runner

      [![Launch Stack](images/launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/template?stackName=SwiftChatAPI&templateURL=https://aws-gcr-solutions.s3.amazonaws.com/swift-chat/latest/SwiftChatAppRunner.template)

    - Lambda (You need to config your Lambda Function URL manually)

2. Click **Next**, On the "Specify stack details" page, provide the following information:
    - Fill the `ApiKeyParam` with the parameter name you used for storing the API key (e.g., "SwiftChatAPIKey").
    - For App Runner, choose an `InstanceTypeParam` based on your needs.
3. Click **Next**, Keep the "Configure stack options" page as default, Read the Capabilities and Check the "I
   acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources" checkbox at the bottom.
4. Click **Next**, In the "Review and create" Review your configuration and click **Submit**.

Wait about 3-5 minutes for the deployment to finish.

**For using App Runner**, click the CloudFormation stack and go to Outputs tab, you can find the **API URL**
(which looks like `https://xxx.xxx.awsapprunner.com`)

**For using Lambda**, follow these steps to get your **API URL** by enabling Lambda Function URL manually:

1. Click the CloudFormation stack and go to **Resources** tab
2. Expand APIHandler under Physical ID, click the Lambda link to open Lambda page
3. In Lambda page, go to **Configuration** -> **Function URL** to enable Lambda Function URL with **RESPONSE_STREAM**
   invoke mode
4. You'll find your Lambda Function URL like `https://xxx.lambda-url.xxx.on.aws` - use this as your **API URL**

### Step 3: Download the app and setup with API URL and API Key

1. Download the App
    - Android App [Download](https://github.com/aws-samples/swift-chat/releases/download/v1.5.0/SwiftChat.apk)
    - macOS App [Download](https://github.com/aws-samples/swift-chat/releases/download/v1.5.0/SwiftChat.dmg)
    - iOS (Currently we do not provide the iOS version, you can build it locally with Xcode)

2. Launch your App, Click the menu button in the top left to open the drawer page, click **Settings** in the bottom of
   the drawer.
3. Paste the API URL and API Key then select the Region.
4. You can change the default text and image model, and **make sure you have enabled these models in your AWS console**.
5. Click the top right finish icon to save your configuration and start your chat.

Congratulations! Your SwiftChat App is ready to use ðŸŽ‰
