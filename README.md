## Architecture

![](/assets/architecture.png)

By default, we use **AWS App Runner**, which is commonly used to host Python FastAPI servers, offering high performance,
scalability and low latency.

Alternatively, we provide the option to replace App Runner with **AWS Lambda** using Function URL for a more
cost-effective
solution, as shown in
this [example](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter/tree/main/examples/fastapi-response-streaming).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have access to Amazon Bedrock foundation models. SwiftChat default settings are:

- Region: `us-west-2`
- Text Model: `Amazon Nova Pro`
- Image Model: `Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large`

If you are using the image generation feature, please make sure you have enabled access to the `Amazon Nova Lite` model.
Please follow the [Amazon Bedrock User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html) to
enable your models.

### Step 1: Set up your API Key

1. Sign in to your AWS console and
   right-click [Parameter Store](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/parameters/) to open it in a new tab.
2. Check whether you are in the [supported region](#supported-region), then click on the **Create parameter** button.
3. Fill in the parameters below, leaving other options as default:

   - **Name**: Enter a parameter name (e.g., "SwiftChatAPIKey", will be used as `ApiKeyParam` in Step 2).

   - **Type**: Select `SecureString`

   - **Value**: Enter any string without spaces.(this will be your `API Key` in Step 3)

4. Click **Create parameter**.

### Step 2: Deploy stack and get your API URL

1. Click one of the following buttons to launch the CloudFormation Stack in the same region where your API Key was
   created.

   - **App Runner**

     [![Launch Stack](assets/launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/template?stackName=SwiftChatAPI&templateURL=https://aws-gcr-solutions.s3.amazonaws.com/swift-chat/latest/SwiftChatAppRunner.template)

   - **Lambda** (Note: For AWS customer use only)

     [![Launch Stack](assets/launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/template?stackName=SwiftChatLambda&templateURL=https://aws-gcr-solutions.s3.amazonaws.com/swift-chat/latest/SwiftChatLambda.template)

2. Click **Next**, On the "Specify stack details" page, provide the following information:
   - Fill the `ApiKeyParam` with the parameter name you used for storing the API key (e.g., "SwiftChatAPIKey").
   - For App Runner, choose an `InstanceTypeParam` based on your needs.
3. Click **Next**, Keep the "Configure stack options" page as default, Read the Capabilities and Check the "I
   acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources" checkbox at the bottom.
4. Click **Next**, In the "Review and create" Review your configuration and click **Submit**.

Wait about 3-5 minutes for the deployment to finish, then click the CloudFormation stack and go to **Outputs** tab, you
can find the **API URL** which looks like: `https://xxx.xxx.awsapprunner.com` or `https://xxx.lambda-url.xxx.on.aws`

### Step 3: Download the app and setup with API URL and API Key

1. Download the App

   - Android App click to [Download](https://github.com/aws-samples/swift-chat/releases/download/1.9.0/SwiftChat.apk)
   - macOS App click to [Download](https://github.com/aws-samples/swift-chat/releases/download/1.9.0/SwiftChat.dmg)
   - iOS (Currently we do not provide the iOS version, you can build it locally with Xcode)

2. Launch the App, open the drawer menu, and tap **Settings**.
3. Paste the `API URL` and `API Key` then select the Region.
4. Click the top right ‚úì icon to save your configuration and start your chat.

Congratulations üéâ Your SwiftChat App is ready to use!

## What Makes SwiftChat Really "Swift"?

üöÄ **Fast Launch Speed**

- Thanks to the **AOT** (Ahead of Time) compilation of RN Hermes engine
- Added **lazy loading** of complex components
- App launches instantly and is immediately ready for input

üåê **Fast Request Speed**

- Speed up end-to-end API requests through **image compression**
- Deploying APIs in the **same region** as Bedrock provides lower latency
- Minimal response payload with **zero parsing** needed for direct display

üì± **Fast Render Speed**

- Using `useMemo` and custom caching to creates secondary cache for session content
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders and speed up streaming messages display
- All UI components are rendered as **native components**

üì¶ **Fast Storage Speed**

- By using **react-native-mmkv** Messages can be read, stored, and updated **10x faster** than AsyncStorage
- Optimized session content and session list storage structure to accelerates history list display

## App Privacy & Security

- Encrypted API key storage
- Minimal permission requirements
- Local-only data storage
- No user behavior tracking
- No data collection
- Privacy-first approach
